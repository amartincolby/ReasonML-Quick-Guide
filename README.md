# ReasonML Quick Guide

ReasonML is a fantastic language. It is, in my eyes, a refinment of OCaml that eliminates many of the syntactic peculiarities of that language that are the result, I assume, of being French.

Sadly, the online documentation for both OCaml and Reason is poor. The community is passionate but small. I started this document as part of a contribution to [Learn X in Y](https://learnxinyminutes.com/), but as I dug deeper into the language and discovered bits that I didn't fully understand, and for which I could not find sufficient elucidation, my work stalled. I did not want to contribute half-finished work, but at the same time, wanted my work to be public in the hope of furthering the ReasonML gospel and helping others. Basically, wisdom is useless if it can't be scraped by Google.

My motivation is also partly that of self edification. As Richard Feynman discussed, the best way to learn is to try to teach. By writing this, I become better at the language. And since I subscribe, in as un-self-important a way as possible, to the idea of "Junior Developer For Life," this repo will forever be a work in progress as I better learn the language. Even now, there are some parts that are incomplete.

As such, I present to you my guide to ReasonML. My general goal is to be as terse as possible, where I clearly communicate what is happening but avoid any unnecessary blather. Below is the Markdown version of the main Reason file at the repo's root. I would be happy to provide further information and also accept criticism and pull requests to this repo. The more content, and the deeper the content, on the web, the better. Let's bring ReasonML to the masses!

# Shout-outs

This guide started as an extension of a more lightweight guide written by ["Seth Corker"](https://sethcorker.com). I was working on my own version at the time and integrated his initial work.

I also want to bring note to the small but dedicated group over at the [ReasonML forums](https://reasonml.chat/). Go there. Just say HI for Pete's sake. Engage! Life springs from activity, and we need more activity, because the technology itself is solid and ready for production use.

# The Guide

Reason is a syntax layer over OCaml. Under the covers, Reason *is* OCaml. It is broadly similar to OCaml but makes changes that bring its syntax better in alignment with C and thus JavaScript. During compilation, Reason is translated into an OCaml abstract syntax tree. The BuckleScript compiler is then used to turn that AST into optimized and easy-to-read JavaScript.

Reason's *raison d'Ãªtre* is to give JavaScript developers a language that is familiar but cleaner, does not require explicit type declarations, and provides algebraically guaranteed type safety. Further, as a syntax layer, code written in Reason can be readily compiled to OCaml and run as a native executable, paving the way for easy Web Assembly and cross-platform development.

The below text is valid ReasonML code. It is a copy of the code in the src directory. 

``` reason
/* Comment blocks start with slash-star,
   and end with star-slash. */
// Line comments begin with a double slash.
// Expressions do not need to be terminated with a semicolon, but it is best practice;

/*** A note on types ***/

/* ReasonML makes little distinction between primitive types and what could be called
    user-defined types or structs. They are simply "things" represented by symbols.

    The below type is an abstract type, meaning that the symbol has no structure attached
    to it. Any program using this type does not need to know its structure just so long
    as usage of the type is consistent. Basically, programs can use symbols without
    knowing what they mean. */

type kwyjibo;

/* The below type is a concrete type with a defined structure. These will appear frequently
    in this guide since any record must have an associated concrete type. */

type thing = {
    value1 : string,
    value2 : int,
};


/*----------------------------------------------
 * Variables, functions, and bindings
 *----------------------------------------------
 */
 
/* In ReasonML, the word "variable" is used as convention but is inaccurate. Variables do
    not vary, i.e. they are immutable. As with many functional languages, variables are more
    accurately referred to as bindings, since what is happening is that a value is being
    irrevocably bound to a symbol, not merely assigned.

    Symbols and values, whether they be functions, primitives, or more complex structures,
    are usually bound with the `let` keyword. Names must begin with a lowercase letter or
    underscore. 

    All values must have a static type, but these types often do not need to be declared in use.
    In most cases, they can be inferred by the compiler via Hindley-Milner classification. */

// The compiler will infer that x is an int.
let x = 5;

// Functions will likewise infer parameter and return types.
let addInts = (a, b) => a + b; // inferred int for all values

// Types can be functions
type intFunction = (int, int) => int;
let intAdder : intFunction = (x, y) => x + y;

// Let bindings are block scoped with braces `{}`.
if (true) {
    let val1 = "best of times";
    print_endline(val1)
};

let myBlock = {
    let val1 = "worst of times";
    print_endline(val1)
};

/* The list of reserved words is broadly similar to OCaml, the list for which is
    available here http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-312/manual044.html.
    The Reason-specific list is under development, with the current words available
    in the ReasonML source code, on Github.

    https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/src/reason-parser/reason_declarative_lexer.mll#L85-L144

    Prefixing a variable name with an underscore creates a casual variable.
    These variables, if unused, will not trigger a compiler warning.
    Unused variable warnings only apply to block scopes and will not be
    raised on variables declared at the global or module level. 
    
    There are two kinds of unused variable. A suspicious unused variable is one
    that has been bound with `let` or `as`. An innocuous variable is one that has
    not been been bound with one of the primary binding verbs. */

let blockScope = () => {
    let variable = 42;          // This triggers a warning.
    let _casualVariable = 2001; // This does not trigger a warning.
    "Return string"
}


/*** Destructuring ***/

// Data structures can be "destructured" for assignment to individual variables.
let aTuple = ("Teacher", 101);
let (name, classNumber) = aTuple;

print_endline(name);
print_int(classNumber);

type person = {
  firstName : string,
  age : int,
};

// Variable extractions from records must match field names.
let bjorn = {firstName : "Bjorn", age : 28};
let {firstName, age} = bjorn;

// Extractions can be re-named before being bound.
let {firstName : bName, age : bAge} = bjorn;

// Fields can be ignored either through omission or the anonymous variable `_`.
let {firstName : cName} = bjorn;
let {firstName : dName, age : _} = bjorn;


/*** Type annotation ***/

// Type annotations can be added when inference does not suffice.
let y: int = 5;

// Function parameters and returns can be annotated.
let add2 = (a: int, b: int): int => a + b;

// A type can be aliased using the `type` keyword.
type companyId = int;
let myId: companyId = 101;

// Mutation, while discouraged, is possible with a `ref()` wrapper.
let myMutableNumber = ref(120);

// To assign a new value, use the `:=` operator.
myMutableNumber := 240;

// To access the value in a `ref()`, use the `^` suffix.
let copyOfMyMutableNumber = myMutableNumber^;


/*** as ***/

/* The second way to perform a symbol/value binding is with `as`. Where a `let`
    binding binds a right-hand value to a left-hand symbol, `as` binds left to right.
    This syntax exists because of the common practice of "piping" something from one
    segment of code into the following segment. This stands in contrast to the
    procedural practice of variable assignment and then, later, variable use.

    Unlike `let`, which must be declared procedurally just like variable declarations
    in most other common languages, the `as` binding can only be declared functionally,
    since it must be passed through to a succeeding block.

    An important difference between `let` binding and `as` is when patterns are evaluated.

    This is an esoteric concept, so do not be dissuaded if it is at first strange and
    incomprehensible. At its root, `as` is an excellent example of the pattern matching
    at the root of modern functional languages. */
    
// Since `as` is a binding, it has paramount precedence.

// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26769403/as-keyword-in-ocaml
// https://reasonml.chat/t/an-explanation-of-as/1912


/* `as` is also used in object assignment in a somewhat similar fashion. See the below
    section on objects to see an explanation. */


/*----------------------------------------------
 * Basic operators
 *----------------------------------------------
 */

/*** > Boolean ***/

// A boolean can be either true or false.
let isLearning = true;

true && false;   // - : bool = false;  Logical and
true || false;   // - : bool = true;   Logical or
!true;           // - : bool = false;  Logical not

'a' > 'b'; // - bool : false
5 < 42;    // - bool : true


/* Equality */

/* Although Reason has `==` and `===`, they are different from JavaScript.
    Structural Equality, using the double-glyph operator, does a deep
    comparison of each entity's structure. Use this judiciously since
    comparing large structures is expensive. */

type author = {
    name : string,
    age  : int
};

let author1 = {
    name : "Charles Dickens",
    age  : 58
};

let author2 = {
    name : "Charles Dickens",
    age  : 58
};

let author3 = {
    name : "Victor Hugo",
    age  : 83
};

author1 == author2; // - : bool = true
author1 == author3; // - : bool = false
author1 != author3; // - : bool = true

/* Any attempt at using greater-than or less-than vis-Ã -vis structures will
    trigger a structural comparison. The comparison will return a boolean as 
    soon as a difference is discovered and will not continue to do a complete
    comparison. */

let bigObj = [10, 10000000, 10000000];
let smallObj = [11, 1, 1];

bigObj > smallObj; // - : bool = false

/* Because 10 and 11 are different, and 10 is smaller than 11, false is returned
    even though the next two values are much larger. */

/* Referential, or physical, equality, using the triple-glyph operator, compares
    the identity of each entity. */

author1 === author2; // - : bool = false
author1 === author1; // - : bool = true


/* Comparing Values */

// The equality operators work differently for values instead of structures.
// Both `==` and `===` will become strict equality `===` when compiled to JavaScript.
// Attempting to compare two different types will cause a compile error.

let myString1 = "A world without string is chaos.";
let myString2 = "A world without string is chaos.";

"A string" === "A string"; // - : bool = true
"A string" == "A string";  // - : bool = true
42 === 42;                 // - : bool = true
42 == 42;                  // - : bool = true
// 42 === "A string" // Error


/*** Operator Assignment ***/

/* Reason is a descendant of Lisp, which means that operations in the language are
    conceptually similar to lists of operations and data. As such, while standard
    infix operator notation is acceptable, so is prefix, or Polish, notation. */

let polishAdder = (a, b) => (+) (a, b);

// Operators are just functions that can be reassigned.
let (+) = (a, b) => a * b;

// Custom operators can use any of the reserved characters.
let ($) = (a, b) => a - b + 3;
4 $ 3   // - : int = 4


/*----------------------------------------------
 * Basic types
 *----------------------------------------------
 */

/*** A note on the standard library (StdLib) ***/

/* All of Reason's types and structures have modules in the standard library. In general,
    it is best to interface with your data via these modules. The abstraction helps
    enable cross-compatibility with native and JavaScript while also providing the usual
    security and guarantees that come with using a standard library.

    While a complete discussion of the StdLib is outside the scope of this tutorial,
    overviews will be given when pertinent.
    
    The list of modules can be found here: https://reasonml.github.io/api/index_modules.html */


/*** > String ***/

/* Strings in Reason map over to strings in JavaScript well. Strings in JavaScript are
    actually immutable under the covers, with the act of changing a string actually creating
    an entirely new string and associating it with a variable name.

    In OCaml, strings can be directly changed, although this unsafe behavior is highly
    discouraged. Further, since JavaScript cannot do this, attempting to do so runs the
    risk of cross-compatibility problems. */

// Use double quotes for strings.
let greeting = "Hello world!";

// Strings can span multiple lines. When compiled, new line characters are generated.
let aLongerGreeting = "Look at me,
I'm a
multi-line string";

// The `{||}` syntax provides functionality akin to backtick strings in JavaScript.
let quotedString = {|It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.|};

let multiLineQuotedString = {|To love another person
is to see
the face of God.|}

// No character escaping is necessary.
let specialCharacters = {|This is fine. !@#'"`$%^&*()|}

// The `js` marker enables unicode.
let world = {js|ð|js};

// The `j` marker enables variable interpolation.
// The parenthesis are optional but required if characters directly follow the variable
let helloWorld = {j|hello, $(world)|j};

// The `$` is reserved to prefix variables and can be escaped with `\`.
let accountBalance = {j|You have \$500.00|j};

// Concatenate strings with `++`.
let name = "John " ++ "Wayne";
let emailSubject = "Hi " ++ name ++ ", you're a valued customer";


/*** > Char ***/

/* Use single quotes for a char. Chars compile to an integer between 0 and 255
    and thus do not support Unicode or UTF-8. */

let lastLetter = 'z';


/*** > Integer ***/

1 + 1;          // - : int = 2
25 - 11;        // - : int = 11
5 * 2 * 3;      // - : int = 30
8 / 2;          // - : int = 4

// Integer division will round results
8 / 3;           // - : int = 2
8 / 5;           // - : int = 1

/* The StdLib provides modules for int32 and int64 operations. Unless these exact
    precisions are necessary, the standard int type provides the best
    cross-compatibility and performance. */


/*** > Float ***/

1.1 +. 1.5;     // - : float = 2.6
18.0 -. 24.5;   // - : float = -6.5
2.5 *. 2.0;     // - : float = 5.0
16.0 /. 4.0;    // - : float = 4.0


/*** > Tuple ***/

/* Tuples are a common data structure found in many languages. For JavaScript developers,
    the argument list passed into a function is the closest analog to a true tuple.

    Tuples are named from the suffix for counting groups, such as double, quintuple,
    or dectuple. For programming purposes, an actual number is used instead of a
    latin-based prefix. So instead of triple, 3-tuple is used.
    
    Tuples can contain two or more values, are immutable and of fixed size, ordered, and
    importantly are heterogenous. It is the last point that most distinguishes tuples from
    arrays or lists. */

let teamMember = ("John", 25);

// Values can be explicitly typed.
let position2d : (float, float) = (9.0, 12.0);
type namedPoint = (string, float, float);
let city1 = ("London", 51.507222, -0.1275);

// An individual value in a tuple cannot be used independently.
// To extract a value from a 2-tuple, use the standard library functions `fst()` and `snd()`.
let memberName = fst(teamMember) /* - : string = "John"  */
let memberAge  = snd(teamMember) /* - : int = 25  */

// Values can also be ignored or extracted via destructuring and the anonymous variable `_`.
let threeTuple = (42, 2001, "A113");
let (theAnswer, _, _) = threeTuple; // theAnswer = 42


/*** > Record ***/

/* Records play part of the role that object literals play in JavaScript and appear most like
    them syntactically. They are collections of key:value pairs that are by default, but not
    necessarily, immutable. The shape of a record -- to wit its key names and value types, but
    not the order in which they appear -- is fixed. This shape must be declared with a type. */

// Like variable names, a type must begin with an underscore or lowercase letter.
type trainJourney = {
    destination  : string,
    capacity     : int,
    averageSpeed : float,
};

// Once declared, types can be inferred by the compiler.
// The below is inferred as type trainJourney
let firstTrainJourney = {
    destination  : "London",
    capacity     : 45,
    averageSpeed : 120.0,
};

// Use dot notation to access properties.
let maxPassengers = firstTrainJourney.capacity;

/* If used immutably, records are not directly changed. Instead, copies of previous records
    are created with new values assigned to particular keys. Creating a new record from a
    previous record uses the spread operator. */

let secondTrainJourney = {...firstTrainJourney, averageSpeed: 105.0};

/* Using records mutably is not generally recommended. That said, it is a powerful tool in
    certain situations. A record cannot be made mutable in its entirety. Individual keys can
    be made mutable with the `mutable` keyword. */

type breakfastCereal = {
  name           : string,
  mutable amount : int,
};

let frostedFlakes = {
    name   : "Kellog's Frosted Flakes",
    amount : 500,
};

frostedFlakes.amount = 200;

/* Match a variable's name & type to a record's key:value to allow "punning", or assigning
    via inferred structure. */
let name = "General Mills Chex";
let amount = 250;
let chex = { // Note how the type did not need to be explicitly declared
    name,
    amount,
};


/*** Object ***/

/* Objects are similar to records but are more class-like in their semantics.
    Notably, they are more like the original conception of objects in that they
    are defined BY THEIR BEHAVIORS, to wit they only expose methods; all values
    are private.
    
    Like classes, objects have private and public methods, identified with the
    `pub` and `pri` keywords. All values are labeled with the `val` keyword.
    Objects have `this` implicitly attached as a binding to all instances of objects.
    
    While objects in Reason are superficially similar to JavaScript objects, they
    do not directly transpile to them. */

// Objects are accessed with hash notation #.
let newObject = {
    val aNumber = ref(42);
    pri increment = (num: int) => aNumber := aNumber^ + num;
    pub addNumber = (inputValue: int) => {
        this#increment(inputValue);
        aNumber^
    };
};

/* Objects do not need types but can have them. There are two categories of type:
    open and closed. They are identified with either one or two dots as the leading
    token of the type's structure. The single dot in the type indicates that this
    is a closed type, meaning that all instances of this type must have a public
    interface of exactly this shape. */

type truck = {
    .
    buildTruck : (~make:string, ~model:string) => string
};

let newTruck: truck = {
    val drive = 4;
    pub buildTruck = (~make, ~model) => {j|You built a new $make $model with $drive-wheel drive.|j};

    // This method is private and will not violate the public shape.
    pri buildEngine = (~cylinders) => {j|You installed a $(cylinders)-cylinder engine.|j}

    // This public method would throw an error because it violates the object shape.
    // pub intruder = "I'm not supposed to be here!";
};

let toyotaTundra = newTruck#buildTruck(~make="Toyota", ~model="Tundra");

/* The double dot, called an elision, indicates that the below is an open type.
    This means that instances of this type do not need to have this exact shape.
    This flexibility means that object types, unlike records, are NOT inferred.
    They must be explicitly declared. */

type car('a) = {
    ..
    accelerate: unit => unit,
    brake: unit => unit
} as 'a;

/* Since open types do not mandate a shape, they are necessarily polymorphic,
    meaning that a closed type must be provided when this object is instantiated.
    The object that is created is classified as the supplied type with the `as` keyword.
    
    The undetermined type is represented by the `'a`, commonly referred to as
    "alpha." Alpha's sibling is `'b`, known as "beta." Alpha commonly represents
    a function's input type while beta represents its return type. This is only
    convention, as the ' simply identifies a type label and the succeeding string
    can be anything. 'steve is equally valid to 'a. 
    
    Below, since `car` is an open type, a closed type is supplied in-line. This in-line
    type is anonymous and only available to the toyotaSupra that has been created. A
    named type could be created and passed in as well. */

let toyotaSupra:  car({. accelerate: unit => unit, brake: unit => unit, checkSpeed: int}) = {
    // as _this;
    val speed = ref(0);
    pub accelerate = () => {
        if (speed^ < 155) {speed := speed^ + 1};
    };
    pub brake = () => {
        if (speed^ > 0) {speed := speed^ - 1};
    };
    pub checkSpeed = speed^;
};

/* The above example is illustrative of the earlier point about `as` vis-a-vis objects.
    A warning underlines the speed val because objects implicitly contain `this`.
    `this` represents the object itself and not simply its behaviors or values. The
    warning will go away either through the use of a private method requiring `this`,
    such as `this#privateMethod`, or through assigning `this` as a casual variable.
    The latter can be achieved with the `as` keyword.
    
    Uncomment the `as _this;` after toyotaSupra's opening bracket to clear the warning. This
    syntax captures the `this` that is implicitly being passed into the object
    construction and reassigns it as the casual `_this`. The usage of `_this` is purely
    for illustrative purposes. The captured `this` can be assigned any casual value to
    prevent the warning. `_t` or `_Steve` are equally valid. 
    
    As of this writing, April 4th, 2020, IDEs seem to have problems with correctly
    underlining object warnings of this sort and will incorrectly underline parts of code.
    Ignore them. The ultimate arbiter of correct code is the Bucklescript compiler and its
    console output.

    *** A note on Objects ***

    The reader perhaps has discerned conflict inherent to objects as described above and
    has forseen a project's future where massive numbers of objects, both open and closed,
    have been created to better match patterns found in languages like Java or C#. These
    objects would rapidly become brittle, fragile, and difficult to extend, even with type
    safety. A full dissection of these concerns is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but 
    suffice it to say that while these abilities are in the language, using them to mimic
    OOP patterns from other languages is widely seen as bad practice. They have their place,
    but only within the context of broader functional concepts. */


/*** > Variant ***/

/* A variant is a type declaration with multiple states. The possible states are called
    constructors because they are not types themselves; they are symbolic identifiers. Further,
    since they are symbols, they should be unique within the current scope, just as any other
    declaration. */

type authType =
    | GitHub
    | Facebook
    | Google
    | Password;

let userPreferredAuth = GitHub;

/* The compiler now knows that `userPreferredAuth` is of type `authType`. and
    that it must necessarily be in one of four states. */

/* Just like any other declaration, how variant constructors are inferred by the type system
    can be changed as the lexical scope progresses. Below, the `authTypeGit` also contains a
    constructor called `GitHub`. As such, any later uses of the `GitHub` constructor will cause
    the compiler to infer a type of `authTypeGit`. For `gitUser1`, this inference is prevented
    through explicit type declaration.

    This situation highlights an interesting aspect of ReasonML's type system: requiring explicit
    type declarations becomes a code smell. */

type authTypeGit =
    | GitHub
    | Gitlab

let gitUser1 : authType = GitHub;
let gitUser2 = GitHub;

/* Constructors "construct" because they accept types as parameters. These types can
    themselves be variants. */

    | Europe
    | South_america
    | North_america;
    
type userType =
    | Admin(authType)
    | Guest
    | Moderator(authType, userRegion);
    
let newUser = Moderator(GitHub, Europe);


/*** > Option ***/

/* At the root of Reason's safety is the concept of possible existence. This is
    not like `null` or `undefined` but an explicit state of nothing. Possible
    existence is handled with the `Option` type. Options are like a variant with
    two states, Some() and None.
    
    Those coming from other functional languages will possibly recognize Some()
    as a monad. For the purposes of this section, a monad is a wrapper of known
    structure that can contain other data. The benefits of monads are as a
    high-level abstraction of computation and structure. They will be further
    discussed in a later section. */

/* isThingHere is of type `option` and either returns a Some() that contains a

    `isThingHere` to account for both states. */


/*** > List ***/

/* A singly-linked list is a language-level structure in ReasonML. They are standard
    singly-linked lists in that they are identified by their heads, they are ordered, their
    consituents are immutable and homogenous, prepending and splitting are constant-time
    operations, while access & updates are linear time operations. */

/*** > Pipe ***/

/* ReasonML has two ways to call functions: the standard syntax and the pipeline
    operator. 

    Conceptually, it is simple. Where `myFunction(value)` says "perform myFunction
    with this value", `(value) -> myFunction` says "send myValue to myFunction."
    
    There is actually a subtle semantic difference between the two. Where the first
    calls the function, the second does not. Instead, it takes a value and applies
    a function to it. From a semantic perspective, this means that calling a
    function either with incorrect data or no data is impossible, since the function
    is not what is being called.
    
    From a syntactic standpoint, this facilitates the easy passing of one function's
    output to another's input. Users of command line interfaces such as Bash will be
    accustomed to this pattern.

    People who are staying abreast of JavaScript development may notice that this
    syntax is currently in the experimental stage in the language specification.
    JavaScript is adopting many ideas from the ML line of languages. */

/*** > Pattern Matching ***/

/* Pattern matching is Reason's crown jewel. It helps prevent all manner
    of errors and unintended behaviors and offers a profound competitive
    advantage in comparison to other languages and tools.
    
    Pattern matching uses decomposition of input to analyze the relationship
    of tokens to find set patterns. This stands in contrast to a direct
    comparison of two values sitting in memory. That sounds fighteningly
    complex but it is actually rather straightforward. A complete discussion
    of pattern matching on a theoretical level is beyond the scope of this
    tour, but it is encouraged to read the Wikipedia page on the subject.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching
    
    In Reason, as with many functional languages, pattern matching is used
    for all comparisons. Sometimes this acts like common value comparisons in
    other languages, like `x === y` in JavaScript. But unlike simple comparisons,
    a pattern has a finite number of states, meaning that the compiler can warn
    the programmer if all possible patterns are not accounted for. This power
    becomes apparent with `switch` statements. */


/*** > Switch ***/

/* The `switch` statement is similar to JavaScript's `switch` but enhanced by
    the power of pattern matching. Indeed, in OCaml, it is called `Match`. In
    this example, the previous `authType` variant is used. */

        | Thief         => "May your enemies see nothing before their deaths."
        | Wizard        => "May your enemies burn from the power in your hands."
    };

/* All four possible states of the dndPlayer type must be accounted for. If the
    switch case for `Wizard` were deleted, the error "this pattern-matching
    is not exhaustive." would be raised by the compiler. Similarly, whenever
    an `option` is used, any `switch` statement must take into account both
    possible states, `some()` and `none`. */

/* As stated, pattern matching is not simply a comparison of values. Complex
    structures can be tested and matched. In this case, the possible analysis
    space is infinite, as opposed to a finite variant, so the final case is the
    anonymous variable, indicating a catch-all that captures everything not
    caught by the previous cases. Just as with `authType`, if the catch-all is
    deleted, a non-exhaustive pattern match error will be raised by the compiler. */

 * Bucklescript

/* As earlier stated, Bucklescript is the transpiler for turning an OCaml syntax tree into
    JavaScript. When ReasonML compiles, it is turned into an OCaml syntax tree and can then
    be pulled into all existing OCaml toolchains. While ReasonML contains many of its own
    JavaScript abilities, accessing the broader JavaScript world requires the use of
    Bucklescript-specific tools. This comes into play most commonly when writing bindings
    between ReasonML and existing JavaScript that cannot be easily converted to ReasonML.

    Bindings are code that take external JavaScript and represent it in ReasonML's symbolic
    system. When transpiled to JavaScript, Bucklescript will generate functions that check
    the consistency of the JavaScript according to the provided bindings. This means that,
    unlike in TypeScript, transpiled ReasonML code is type safe. It will perform run-time
    checks, injecting stability and debuggability into the application in case of unexpected
    external input, as from the response from an API. 
    
    In the below example, the %bs.raw decorator allows direct injection of JavaScript. What
    the JavaScript accepts from ReasonML and what it returns to ReasonML must still be typed,
    but there are no guarantees that the JavaScript will actually accept or return what is

 * Belt
 *----------------------------------------------
 */

/* Belt is an implementation/extension of OCaml's standard library that provides additional tools
    specifically to facilitate transpilation to JavaScript. From the perpsective of JavaScript
    developers, the best analogy is Lodash. Unlike Lodash, Belt comes along as a native part of
    Bucklescript. As of February 2020, Belt is officially in beta, with breaking changes
    periodically occuring. That said, it is mostly stable and widely used by developers in the
    community.

    Belt possesses much of the same functionality as the Js module. It is recommended to use Belt
    instead of Js since it prevents application logic from being tied to JavaScript.
    
    There are two parts to the Belt library: the primary module and the "flattened" modules. The
    primary module has sub-modules, each of which contain functions for manipulating data. The
    flattened modules are prefixed with Belt_, such as Belt_Map, and are the legacy tools. The
    primary module is intended to ultimately provide all of the same functionality of the flattened
    modules, but it is a work in progress. Currently, the flattened modules provide some
    additional functionality, such as tools for manipulating AVL trees.
    
    When given the choice, do not use the flattened modules unless a particular piece of functionality
    is utterly necessary. The flattened modules will disappear at some point in a future version of
    Bucklescript. */

let testArray = [|"1", "2", "3"|];

Belt.Array.forEach(testArray, (element) => {
    Js.log(element);
});

// The flattened module does the same thing. It is simply deprecated syntax.

Belt_Array.forEach(testArray, (element) => {
    Js.log(element);
});

 * ReasonReact

 */

/* ReasonML was created by the same person, Jordan Walke, that created React. It could be seen
    as a language created specifically to enable faster, more reliable production of React apps.
    React and ReasonML have walked hand-in-hand because of this, meaning that much of the
    discussion surrounding the language has focused on React. ReasonReact's home page is even
    hosted on the same domain as ReasonML. As such, it is sensible to include an overview of the
    React library's bindings. */

[@react.component]
let make = (~food) => {
    let (amount, eat) = React.useState( () => 0 );
    let eatMore = () => { eat( (_) => { amount + 1 } ) };
    <div>
        <p> { React.string( {j| $food monster has eaten $amount $(food)s |j} ) }</p>
        <button onClick={ (_ev) => eatMore() }>{ React.string( {j| Eat $food |j} ) }</button>
    </div>
};

/* The above abstracts away much of React's boilerplate. All that must be written are the
    decorator and the render function, which is called `make`. The example is a variation
    on the standard React Hooks example available on React's website, and the ReasonML version
    available on the ReasonReact site.

    The labeled arguments constitute the component's props. The next line is the state Hook.
    `useState` returns a 2-tuple, with the first element being the value to store and the second
    being the function that can change that value. With destructuring, the names `amount`
    and `eat` are bound to the values. `useState` takes a single argument, a function that
    initializes the state value. In the above case, an inital value of `int : 0` is bound to
    `amount`.

    The returned function, `eat`, is a wrapper that adds a signature to, and then returns, a 
    provided function. In this example, the anonymous function passed into `eat` is signed as 
    accepting an integer and returning an integer. Any function passed into `eat` must follow the 
    same signature.
    
    `eatMore` is a wrapper function that calls `eat`. `eat` cannot be directly called because 
    the function must accept a React Event, while functions that can change the state will only
    accept the same type that they return, in this case an integer. `eatMore` is a single-use
    function with no special signature. The function passed into `eat` must accept an integer,
    but there is no integer to provide. An anonymous variable is provided since it fulfills any
    type requirement.

    The final piece of JSX is the implicitly returned value. All strings must be placed in the
    typed wrapper React.string(). The `onClick` event automatically captures the React event and
    passes it into the provided function. In this example, an underscore is used to create a
    casual variable. Since the event is not being used, a warning would otherwise be displayed.

    The above steps and nested functions may seem overly complex, but it is the nature of
    functional programming that steps are not broken down by passing arguments or mutating values.
    Instead, steps are taken with the progressive application of signed and typed functions.

    ReasonReact is built around Hooks and supports all of them. The older API is deprecated.

 * Monads
 *----------------------------------------------
 */

/* ReasonML is a functional language, meaning that processes are based on the evaluations of
    mathematical functions. This means that for the same inputs, the program will always return
    the same output. This results in the problem of how a program is to have state or handle effects.
    Common programs have a great many effects, such as logs, timers, I/O, etc. Functional
    languages solve these problems with through the use of monads. 
    
    ReasonML, and OCaml before it, made practical concessions to the needs of developers by allowing,
    and having language structures for, effects and state. It did not forget the lessons of monads,
    though, and has a few on the language level. Most notable, and most striking to developers coming
    from more procedural languages, is Option.
    
    A monad is simply a structure that follows certain rules. Monads are not peculiar to functional
    languages. They simply arose in usage in that context because they were necessary for solving
    certain problems. Their utility has become apparent, with other languages adopting common monads
    like Option. Scala, Kotlin, C#, and Java all now have optional values as part of the language.
    Indeed, monads generally are becoming common. JavaScript has perhaps the most widely used monad in
    computer history in the form of the promise.
    
    The purpose of this section therefore is to bring focus to their genesis and hopefully explain
    why knowledge of monads, and category theory more broadly, is an extremely fruitful course of
    investigation. */
